lets dev

whats up guys,
please run the command "npm install" after cloning the repository into your machines.
you will need to have node installed in your machines.
1. install node
2. node comes with npm
3. update npm
4. after updating npm, run npm install. this will install all the dependencies that are needed by the app.
5. to run the app fire the command "npm run dev". this will fire node lite server and automatically launch the app on the browser. note that you have to do these tasks in this order
6. to run the unit tests, fire npm run test. this will tell karma to start looking for available unit tests and will also automatically show start chrome and output the result of the tests on the commandline interface.
7. please note that i am not fully up to speed with how to install these things (node and npm) on windows. but it should be fairly easy.
8. melusi will have to make a repo for the backend.
9. I know it may seem like i have not done much when just running the app.
